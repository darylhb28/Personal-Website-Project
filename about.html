            About Me
        </h2>
            <p>
                After a decade in the public policy and education world, I decided to pursue my combined passions for good governance and technology to build a career at the intersection of the two. I hope to bring coding skills into the public sector to improve people’s lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m a born and raised Brooklynite, still living and working there with my wife. In my free time I love watching scary movies, cooking, and yelling about the New York Mets.
